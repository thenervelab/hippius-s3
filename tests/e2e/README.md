# E2E Tests for Hippius S3

This directory contains end-to-end tests that verify the full Hippius S3 pipeline from S3 client to IPFS storage and blockchain publishing.

## Current Setup (with bypass flags)

The tests currently use environment variable bypasses to skip credit checks and blockchain publishing:

- `HIPPIUS_BYPASS_CREDIT_CHECK=true` - Skips credit verification for write operations
- `HIPPIUS_PUBLISH_MODE=ipfs_only` - Uses IPFS-only mode instead of full blockchain publishing for single file uploads

These bypasses allow tests to run without:

- A funded blockchain account
- Chain connectivity
- Credit verification

**Note**: Multipart uploads are not currently bypassed and still require full blockchain publishing. The current tests focus on single-file operations only.

## Running the Tests

```bash
# Run e2e tests
pytest tests/e2e/ -v
```

### Run against real AWS (optional)

You can run the same tests against AWS S3 to validate test expectations.

Requirements:

- AWS credentials configured (env vars, default profile, or other supported methods)
- A region with S3 enabled (default: us-east-1)

Command:

```bash
RUN_REAL_AWS=1 AWS_REGION=us-east-1 pytest tests/e2e -v -m 'not local_only'
```

Notes:

- Some tests may be marked `local_only` if they exercise Hippius-specific endpoints/behaviors.
- Buckets are created with globally unique names and cleaned up after tests, but charges may apply.

## Making Tests Truly E2E (Removing Bypasses)

To make the tests truly end-to-end, you need to:

### 1. Remove Environment Bypasses

Remove these from `docker-compose.e2e.yml` (they are set under the `api`, `pinner`, and `unpinner` services):

```yaml
# In docker-compose.e2e.yml
services:
  api:
    environment:
      # delete these lines
      - HIPPIUS_BYPASS_CREDIT_CHECK=true
      - HIPPIUS_PUBLISH_MODE=ipfs_only
  pinner:
    environment:
      # delete this line
      - HIPPIUS_PUBLISH_MODE=ipfs_only
  unpinner:
    environment:
      # delete this line
      - HIPPIUS_PUBLISH_MODE=ipfs_only
```

### 2. Remove Bypass Code from Source

Remove bypass logic from:

- `hippius_s3/api/middlewares/credit_check.py` - Remove the `HIPPIUS_BYPASS_CREDIT_CHECK` check
- `hippius_s3/api/s3/endpoints.py` - Remove the `HIPPIUS_PUBLISH_MODE` check
- `hippius_s3/ipfs_service.py` - Remove the `HIPPIUS_PUBLISH_MODE` check

### 3. Set Up Blockchain Infrastructure

Add to `docker-compose.yml`:

```yaml
services:
  # Add a local Hippius/Substrate devnet
  substrate:
    image: hippius/substrate:latest # Or appropriate image
    ports:
      - "9944:9944" # RPC port
    environment:
      - CHAIN=dev
    # Pre-fund test accounts in genesis

  # Optional: Add a faucet service
  faucet:
    image: hippius/faucet:latest
    depends_on:
      - substrate
    environment:
      - SUBSTRATE_RPC_URL=http://substrate:9944
```

### 4. Configure Chain Connection

Add environment variables:

```bash
# In docker-compose.yml or test setup
HIPPIUS_SUBSTRATE_RPC_URL=http://substrate:9944
```

Update `hippius_s3/dependencies.py` to use configurable RPC URL:

```python
# In check_account_has_credit()
substrate_client = SubstrateClient(
    rpc_url=os.getenv("HIPPIUS_SUBSTRATE_RPC_URL"),
    password=None,
    account_name=None
)
```

### 5. Fund Test Account

Either:

- Pre-fund the test seed in the devnet genesis
- Use a faucet to fund the account before running tests
- Generate a new seed per test run and fund it

### 6. Update Test Configuration

Modify `conftest.py`:

```python
@pytest.fixture(scope="session")
def test_seed_phrase():
    """Generate a funded test seed phrase."""
    # Option 1: Use pre-funded seed
    return "funded twelve word seed phrase"

    # Option 2: Generate and fund via faucet
    # seed = generate_new_seed()
    # fund_account_via_faucet(seed)
    # return seed
```

### 7. Add Verification Steps

After upload operations, verify on-chain:

```python
# In test_single_file_upload.py
def verify_on_chain(tx_hash):
    """Verify transaction exists on blockchain."""
    # Use Hippius SDK to query transaction
    substrate_client = SubstrateClient(rpc_url="http://substrate:9944")
    tx_info = substrate_client.get_transaction(tx_hash)
    assert tx_info is not None
    assert tx_info["status"] == "finalized"
```

### 8. Handle Timing

Blockchain operations introduce latency. Add polling:

```python
def wait_for_publish(bucket, key, timeout=30):
    """Wait for object to be fully published."""
    start_time = time.time()
    while time.time() - start_time < timeout:
        obj = boto3_client.get_object(Bucket=bucket, Key=key)
        metadata = obj.get("Metadata", {})
        if metadata.get("hippius", {}).get("tx_hash"):
            return obj
        time.sleep(2)
    raise TimeoutError("Object not published within timeout")
```

## Test Flow (True E2E)

1. **Account Setup**: Verify/fund test seed has credit
2. **Bucket Creation**: PUT /{bucket}
3. **File Upload**: PUT /{bucket}/{key} â†’ IPFS upload + encrypt + pin + blockchain publish
4. **Verification**:
   - GET /{bucket}/{key} returns decrypted content
   - On-chain verification of transaction
5. **Cleanup**: DELETE /{bucket}/{key}, DELETE /{bucket}

## Migration Steps

1. âœ… Add bypass flags (current state)
2. ðŸ”„ Set up local devnet infrastructure
3. ðŸ”„ Fund test accounts
4. ðŸ”„ Remove bypass flags from code
5. ðŸ”„ Add on-chain verification
6. ðŸ”„ Update CI/CD to use real chain

## Security Notes

- Never commit funded seed phrases to version control
- Use CI secrets for funded accounts
- Consider rotating test seeds periodically
- Monitor chain costs for test accounts
