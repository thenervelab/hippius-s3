## 4. Copyright Infringement and DMCA Compliance

Hippius respects the intellectual property rights of others and expects its users to do the same. We comply with the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA) and similar international copyright frameworks.

### 4.1 Reporting Copyright Infringement

If you believe that content hosted on Hippius Services infringes your copyright, you may submit a takedown notice to our designated agent. Your notice must include:

1. A physical or electronic signature of the copyright owner or authorized representative.
2. Identification of the copyrighted work claimed to have been infringed.
3. Identification of the material claimed to be infringing, including sufficient information for us to locate it (e.g., bucket name, object key, or URL).
4. Your contact information (name, address, telephone number, and email address).
5. A statement that you have a good faith belief that the use of the material is not authorized by the copyright owner, its agent, or the law.
6. A statement, made under penalty of perjury, that the information in the notice is accurate and that you are the copyright owner or authorized to act on the owner's behalf.

Send takedown notices to: **legal@hippius.com**

### 4.2 Repeat Infringer Policy

Hippius maintains a policy of terminating, in appropriate circumstances, accounts of users who are repeat infringers of intellectual property rights. We track infringement reports per account and may:

- Issue a warning upon the first substantiated report.
- Suspend upload capabilities upon a second substantiated report.
- Permanently terminate the account and delete all stored content upon a third substantiated report or upon any single egregious violation.

### 4.3 Counter-Notification

If you believe your content was removed in error, you may submit a counter-notification in accordance with the DMCA. We will process counter-notifications and restore content as required by applicable law.

## 5. Enforcement and Consequences

Hippius reserves the right, but is not obligated, to investigate any suspected violation of this AUP. Upon determining a violation, we may, at our sole discretion and without prior notice:

- **Remove or disable access** to any content that violates this AUP.
- **Suspend or terminate** your account and access to all Hippius Services.
- **Report violations** to appropriate law enforcement authorities, including providing any information we hold that may assist in investigation or prosecution.
- **Cooperate with law enforcement** investigations and legal proceedings, including complying with valid court orders, subpoenas, or other legal processes.

Hippius will fully cooperate with law enforcement authorities in investigating and prosecuting users who violate this AUP, particularly in cases involving child exploitation material, terrorism-related content, or large-scale copyright infringement.

## 6. Content Monitoring and Removal

### 6.1 No Obligation to Monitor

Hippius is a decentralized storage infrastructure provider. We do not routinely monitor, review, or edit user content. The nature of our service, which may include client-side encryption and decentralized storage across multiple backends, means that content inspection is not always technically feasible.

### 6.2 Right to Act

Notwithstanding the above, Hippius reserves the right to remove any content or suspend any account at any time if we have reason to believe a violation of this AUP has occurred, or if required to do so by applicable law or regulation.

### 6.3 Automated Detection

We may implement automated systems to detect certain categories of prohibited content (e.g., known CSAM hashes, malware signatures). Users acknowledge and consent to such scanning where technically feasible.

## 7. Limitation of Liability

Hippius provides storage infrastructure on an "as-is" basis. We are not the publisher or originator of user-uploaded content and shall not be held liable for content stored by users of the Services. To the maximum extent permitted by applicable law:

- Hippius shall not be liable for any user content or for any claims arising from the storage, transmission, or distribution of user content through the Services.
- Users shall indemnify, defend, and hold harmless Hippius, its officers, directors, employees, and agents from and against any and all claims, liabilities, damages, losses, and expenses (including reasonable legal fees) arising from or related to the user's content or use of the Services.
- Hippius's total aggregate liability for any claims arising under or related to this AUP shall not exceed the total fees paid by the user during the twelve (12) months preceding the claim.

When reporting, please include:

## 9. Governing Law

This AUP and any disputes arising from it shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the jurisdiction in which Hippius is incorporated, without regard to conflict of law principles.

---

## 10. Changes to This Policy

We may update this AUP from time to time. Material changes will be posted on our website at [hippius.com](https://hippius.com) and will become effective upon posting. Your continued use of the Services after any changes constitutes acceptance of the updated AUP.
